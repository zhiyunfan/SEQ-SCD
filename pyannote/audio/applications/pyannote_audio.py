Neural building blocks for speaker diarization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage:
  pyannote-audio (sad | scd | ovl | emb | dom) train    [--cpu | --gpu] [options] <root>     <protocol>
  pyannote-audio (sad | scd | ovl | emb | dom) validate [--cpu | --gpu] [options] <train>    <protocol>
  pyannote-audio (sad | scd | ovl | emb | dom) apply    [--cpu | --gpu] [options] <validate> <protocol>
  pyannote-audio -h | --help
  pyannote-audio --version

This command line tool can be used to train, validate, and apply neural networks
for the following blocks of a speaker diarization pipeline:

    * (sad) speech activity detection consists in detecting speech regions in
            an audio recording.
    * (scd) speaker change detection consists in detecting timestamps of
            speaker change point.
    * (ovl) overlapped speech detection consists in detection regions with two
            or more simultaneous speakers.
    * (emb) speaker embedding consists in projecting audio chunk into a
            (usually high-dimensional) vector space where same speaker
            embeddings are close to each other, and different speaker embeddings
            are not.
    * (dom) domain classification consists in predicting the domain of an
            audio recording

Running a complete speech activity detection experiment on the provided
"debug" dataset would go like this:

    * Run experiment on this pyannote.database protocol
      $ export DATABASE=Debug.SpeakerDiarization.Debug

    * This directory will contain experiments artifacts:
      $ mkdir my_experiment && cd my_experiment

    * A unique configuration file describes the experiment hyper-parameters
      (see "Configuration file" below for details):
      $ edit config.yml

    * This will train the model on the training set:
      $ pyannote-audio sad train ${PWD} ${DATABASE}

    * Training artifacts (including model weights) are stored in a sub-directory
      whose name makes it clear which dataset and subset (train, by default)
      were used for training the model.
      $ cd train/${DATABASE}.train

    * This will validate the model on the development set:
      $ pyannote-audio sad validate ${PWD} ${DATABASE}

    * Validation artifacts (including the selection of the best epoch) are
      stored in a sub-directory named after the dataset and subset (development,
      by default) used for validating the model.
      $ cd validate/${DATABASE}.development

    * This will apply the best model (according to the validation step) to the
      test set:
      $ pyannote-audio sad apply ${PWD} ${DATABASE}

    * Inference artifacts are stored in a sub-directory whose name makes it
      clear which epoch has been used (e.g. apply/0125). Artifacts include:
        * raw output of the best model (one numpy array per file  than can be
          loaded with pyannote.audio.features.Precomputed API and handled with
          pyannote.core.SlidingWindowFeature API)
        * (depending on the task) a file "${DATABASE}.test.rttm" containing the
          post-processing of raw output.
        * (depending on the task) a file "${DATABASE}.test.eval" containing the
          evaluation result computed with pyannote.metrics.

pyannote.database support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PYANNOTE_DATABASE_CONFIG=

Configuration file <root>/config.yml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Reproducible research is facilitated by the systematic use of configuration
    files stored in <root>/config.yml in YAML format.

    .......................... <root>/config.yml ..........................
    task:
        name:
        params:

    feature_extraction:
        name:
        params:

    data_augmentation:
        name:
        params:

    architecture:
        name:
        params:

    scheduler:
        name:
        params:

    preprocessors:

    callbacks:
    ...................................................................

    File <root>/config.yml is mandatory, unless option --pretrained is used.

    When fine-tuning a model with option --pretrained=<model>, one can omit it
    and the original <model> configuration file is used instead. If (a possibly
    partial) <root>/config.yml file is provided anyway, it is used to override
    <model> configuration file.

Tensorboard support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    A bunch of metrics are logged during training and validation (e.g. loss,
    learning rate, computation time, validation metric). They can be visualized
    using tensorboard:

        $ tensorboard --logdir=<root>

Common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  <root>                  Experiment root directory. Should contain config.yml
                          configuration file, unless --pretrained option is
                          used (for which config.yml is optional).

  <protocol>              Name of protocol to use for training, validation, or
                          inference. Have a look at pyannote.database
                          documentation for instructions on how to define a
                          protocol with your own dataset:
                          https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-database#custom-protocols

  <train>                 Path to <root> sub-directory containing training
                          artifacts (e.g. <root>/train/<protocol>.train)

  <validate>              Path to <train> sub-directory containing validation
                          artifacts (e.g. <train>/validate/<protocol>.development)
                          In case option --pretrained=<model> is used, the
                          output of the pretrained model is dumped into the
                          <validate> directory.

  --subset=<subset>       Subset to use for training (resp. validation,
                          inference). Defaults to "train" (resp. "development",
                          "test") for strict enforcement of machine learning
                          good practices.

  --gpu                   Run on GPU. When multiple GPUs are available, use
                          CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable to force
                          using a specific one. Defaults to using CPU if no GPU
                          is available.

  --cpu                   Run on CPU. Defaults to using GPU when available.

  --debug                 Run using PyTorch's anomaly detection. This will throw
                          an error if a NaN value is produced, and the stacktrace
                          will point to the origin of it. This option can
                          considerably slow execution.

  --from=<epoch>          Start training (resp. validating) at epoch <epoch>.
                          Use --from=last to start from last available epoch at
                          launch time. Not used for inference [default: 0].

  --to=<epoch>            End training (resp. validating) at epoch <epoch>.
                          Use --end=last to validate until last available epoch
                          at launch time. Not used for inference [default: 100].

  --batch=<size>          Set batch size used for validation and inference.
                          Has no effect when training as this parameter should
                          be defined in the configuration file [default: 32].

  --step=<ratio>          Ratio of audio chunk duration used as step between
                          two consecutive audio chunks [default: 1.0]

  --parallel=<n_jobs>     Use at most that many threads for generating training
                          samples or validating files. Defaults to using all
                          CPUs but one.

  --oracle_vad=<bool>

  --down_rate=<int>

  --spk_path=<str>

  --up_bound=<float>

  --collar=<float>

  --best_threshold=<float>


Speaker embedding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  --duration=<duration>   Use audio chunks with that duration. Defaults to the
                          fixed duration used during training, when available.

  --metric=<metric>       Use this metric (e.g. "cosine" or "euclidean") to
                          compare embeddings. Defaults to the metric defined in
                          <root>/config.yml configuration file.

Pretrained model options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  --pretrained=<model>    Warm start training with pre-trained model. Can be
                          either a path to an existing checkpoint (e.g.
                          <train>/weights/0050.pt) or the name of a model
                          available in torch.hub.list('pyannote/pyannote.audio')
                          This option can also be used to apply a pretrained
                          model. See description of <validate> for more details.

Validation options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  --every=<epoch>         Validate model every <epoch> epochs [default: 1].

  --evergreen             Prioritize validation of most recent epoch.

  For speech activity and overlapped speech detection, validation consists in
  looking for the value of the detection threshold that maximizes the f-score
  of recall and precision.

  For speaker change detection, validation consists in looking for the value of
  the peak detection threshold that maximizes the f-score of purity and
  coverage:

  --diarization           Use diarization purity and coverage instead of
                          (default) segmentation purity and coverage.

  For speaker embedding and verification protocols, validation runs the actual
  speaker verification experiment (representing each recording by its average
  embedding) and reports equal error rate.

  For speaker embedding and diarization protocols, validation runs a speaker
  diarization pipeline based on oracle segmentation and "pool-linkage"
  agglomerative clustering of speech turns (represented by their average
  embedding), and looks for the threshold that maximizes the f-score of purity
  and coverage.
